### Links that I have found useful:
1. [**Beginner Linux Tutorial**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1y-mbWM3B8)  
   The video I used to learn about Linux, as I have no previous knowledge about it. The video contains most of the things I needed to start my OS adventure.
2. [**C Programming Exercise**](https://w3resource.com/c-programming-exercises/)  
   The website I used to get to know C syntaxes. It helps in learning the C language as it is suggested that further assignments may involve coding in C.
3. [**grep, sed, and awk**](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/grep-sed-awk-differences)  
   Explains the different use cases for the three commands. Very useful in manipulating files in Linux.
4. [**Linux File System Explained in 1233 seconds**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3G-3hp88mo)  
   The video does exactly what the title says, and does it well, too.
5. [**Pointers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw1qsMieK5c)  
   Gives an insight on what pointers do in C.
6. [**Fork()**](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/fork-in-c-programming-language/)  
   Explains what a fork command does in C with visualizations
7. [**Threads and Concurrency**](https://applied-programming.github.io/Operating-Systems-Notes/3-Threads-and-Concurrency/)  
   Summarizes threads and concurrency concisely using examples and visualizations
