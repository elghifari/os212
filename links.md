### Links that I have found useful:
1. [**Beginner Linux Tutorial**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1y-mbWM3B8)  
   The video I used to learn about Linux, as I have no previous knowledge about it. The video contains most of the things I needed to start my OS adventure
2. [**C Programming Exercise**](https://w3resource.com/c-programming-exercises/)  
   The website I used to get to know C syntaxes. It helps in learning the C language as it is suggested that further assignments may involve coding in C.
3. [**grep, sed, and awk**](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/grep-sed-awk-differences)  
   Explains the different use cases for the three commands. Very useful in manipulating files in Linux.
